									<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Based on the exciting talk by Clarity Techworks Sdn.Bhd, I had gained the information, 
									deeper understanding and further knowledge on future career. The speaker introduces the 
									overview of the Information Technology sector especially in fintech. Furthermore, the talk 
									also makes me realise the lack of fundamental knowledge in the job such as web developer, 
									UI/UX designer and Android and IOS developer. In sum, I would always improve myself by 
									pursuing more knowledge in programming and sharpening my communication skills to become a 
									successful network engineer in the future.</p>

									<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
								</header>
								<p>This UTMDigital industrial visit offered me a great opportunity to learn about data management 
									and digital services in UTM. Experiencing the real working environment enhanced my understanding 
									of information systems and tech applications in organizational contexts. Exploring UTM Digital 
									Care showcased practical aspects of customer access and engagement. Discussion rooms highlighted 
									collaborative spaces, fostering creativity and effective communication. The visit to UTM Data 
									Centre offered insights into managing physical servers, underlining their critical role. 
									Witnessing technological innovations in action provides valuable insights for our future careers. 
									This has grown a great interest inside of me.</p>

									<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Based on this industrial talk, I have gained a clear picture into the workings of a computing 
									company dedicated to the growth of cloud and digital services analytics. According to Ms. Qistina Batrisyia 
									binti Azman Shah, the learning process is the most critical path, especially when we are introduced to a new 
									technology. Through this talk, I clearly know the challenges face by a system developer. In conclusion, 
									Credence Systems Corporation's system development path has influenced my understanding of how technology and 
									analytics are intertwined. Thus, people can use the Credence System to enter the unknown world of the metaverse 
									and explore the unknown.</p>

									<h2>Assignment 4</h2>
								</header>
								<p>This talk provides valuable information about the importance of technology to humans. For example, cloud 
									computing helps I-Farm to store and retrieve large volumes of data and IoT are employed in agriculture to
									monitor and control farming processes. IoT also ensures transparency in the supply chain, allowing 
									consumers to trace the origin of their vegetables and farmers to monitor the status of their shipments. 
									By bringing the market online, users may have easier access to a wider variety of produce, potentially 
									sourced directly from farms. This also reduces environmental impact through optimized resource usage and 
									minimized waste</p>

									<h2>PC Assemble</h2>
								</header>
								<p>By doing PC assembly, I learned about tools used for assembling computer parts, parts of the motherboard, 
									the uses of cable in the motherboard and steps in PC assembly. PC assembly is useful for recycling old or 
									used computer parts and changing internal parts of the computer. In my point of view, PC assembly is a 
									fundamental skill that necessary for every computer science student.</p>

									<h2>Design Thinking</h2>
								</header>
								<p>The design thinking prototype is highly beneficial as it enables me to explore the convergence of technology
									 in both physical objects and software. This design thinking project has inspired me to create more 
									 applications or new technologies that would bring the public a better day and help people to complete 
									 their tasks in daily life.</p>
